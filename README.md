# _The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course_ Outline

## Overview

- Outline of [The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/) by Rob Percival and Mashrur Hossain. This is a work in progress. Not all lectures will be accounted for. (Current as of September 2021.)

### Section 2: The Ruby Programming Language

#### Introduction to Ruby

- Link to the [official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

- Basic "Hello World":

  ```ruby
  puts "Hello World"  # Prints "Hello World" (followed by newline) and returns `nil`.

  # Define a method:
  def say_hello
    p "Hello World"
  end

  say_hello  # Prints "Hello World" (followed by newline) and returns the string.

  # Define a method that accepts an argument:
  def say_something(str)
    print str
  end

  # Assign a string to a variable:
  greeting = "Hello World"

  say_something greeting  # Prints "Hello World" (without a newline) and returns `nil`.
  ```

- Run a Ruby file (any file with an `.rb` extension) by running `ruby <file_name>.rb`.

- Quickly access an interactive Ruby environment by running `irb` in your terminal.

#### Working with Strings

- Strings can be set with either single or double quotation marks: `'John'` or `"John"`.

- String interpolation is only possible when using double quotation marks:

  ```ruby
  first_name = 'John'
  last_name = 'Doe'

  "My name is #{first_name} #{last_name}."

  # => "My name is John Doe."
  ```

- Determine whether a value is a string (or any other class type) by using the `.class` method:

  ```ruby
  "John".class

  # => String
  ```

- View all available string methods: `"John".methods`

- Examples of string methods:

  ```ruby
  # Uppercase and reverse:
  "John".upcase.reverse

  # => "NHOJ"
  ```

  ```ruby
  # Substitute string characters:
  sentence = 'Welcome to the jungle.'
  sentence.sub('the jungle', 'utopia')

  # => "Welcome to utopia."
  ```

  ```ruby
  # Convert a string to an integer:
  input = '10'
  input.to_i

  # => 10
  ```

#### Working with Numbers

- All numbers without decimals will operate as integers and will only yield integers as their calculated result. If a calculated result should contain a decimal, then at least one number in the calculation must be a float:

  ```ruby
  10 / 4

  # => 2

  10.0 / 4

  # => 2.5

  # Convert 4 to a float:
  10 / 4.to_f

  # => 2.5
  ```

- A string can be multiplied by a number to perform string concatenation:

  ```ruby
  '-' * 20

  # => "--------------------"
  ```

  - Alternative method: `20.times { print '-' }`

#### Comparison Operators

- Basic operators:

  ```ruby
  ==  # Equal to

  !=  # Not equal to

  >   # Greater than

  >=  # Greater than or equal to

  <   # Less than

  <=  # Less than or equal to
  ```

  - **NOTE:** Ruby supports the `===` operator, but it behaves as a [case subsumption operator](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4467823/9027907).

- To check if two values are equal both in value and type, use `.eql?`:

  ```ruby
  10.eql?(10.0)

  # => false

  10.eql?(10)

  # => true
  ```

#### Methods

- Ruby automatically returns the last evaluated expression within a method, so no `return` keyword is necessary:

  ```ruby
  def multiply(a, b)
    a * b
  end

  multiply(2, 3)

  # => 6
  ```

#### Branching

- Example:

  ```ruby
  if foo && bar
    puts 'Both foo and bar are true.'
  elsif foo || !bar
    puts 'Either foo is true, or bar is false.'
  else
    puts 'ðŸ™ƒ'
  end
  ```

#### Arrays and Iterators

- Basic array methods:

  ```ruby
  arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]

  arr.last

  # => 4

  arr.shuffle

  # => [2, 3, 1, 4]

  # Original array has not been mutated.
  arr

  # => [1, 2, 3, 4]

  arr.shuffle!

  # => [4, 3, 1, 2]

  # The original array has been mutated due to adding `!` after `.shuffle`:
  arr

  # => [4, 3, 1, 2]

  arr.unshift(0)

  # => [0, 4, 3, 1, 2]

  arr.append(5)
  arr << 6

  # => [0, 4, 3, 1, 2, 5, 6]

  arr.empty?

  # => false

  arr.include?(7)

  # => false
  ```

  - Ruby arrays also include other standard programming methods; e.g.: `.push`, `.pop`, `.join`, `.split`.

- A range can be converted to an array:

  ```ruby
  (1..4).to_a

  # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

- Create an array of strings:

  ```ruby
  %w(foo bar baz)

  # => ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

  _

  # => ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
  ```

  - **TIP:** The last used value is automatically assigned to the `_` (underscore) variable, which can be accessed at any time.

- Iterate over an array by using the `.each` method:

  ```ruby
  arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]

  # Print 1234:
  arr.each do |i|
    print i
  end

  # Alternative syntax for single-line statements:
  arr.each { |i| print i }
  ```

  - This method of iteration is generally preferred over a `for` loop:

    ```ruby
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]

    for i in arr
      print i
    end
    ```

- Filter an array with the `.select` method:

  ```ruby
  arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]

  # Select only the odd numbers in the array:
  arr.select { |i| i.odd? }

  # => [1, 3]
  ```

### Section 13: Rails Installation and Usage (Mac)

#### Install RVM (Ruby Version Manager)

- Go to [Installing RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and follow the installation instructions.

#### Install Ruby

- Run `rvm list` to see what versions of Ruby have been installed on your system.

- Run `rvm list known` to see all versions of Ruby that are available for installation.

- Run `rvm install <version>` to install a specific version of Ruby (e.g., `rvm install ruby-3`).

- Run `rvm --default use <version>` to set a specific version to be the default interpreter (if more than one version is installed).

- Run `rvm use <version>` to switch to a specific version, and run `rvm use default` to switch back to the default version.

#### Install and Use Ruby on Rails 6

- Install the following gems:

  - `gem install bundler`

  - `gem install webpacker` (makes it easy for your Rails application to work with Webpack)

- Run `gem install rails` to install the latest stable version of Rails. Alternatively, install a specific version (e.g., `gem install rails -v 6.1.4`).

- Run `gem list rails` to verify your installation of Rails.

- Run `rails new <app_name>` to create a new Rails application in the current directory.

- Run `rails s` from within your new application's root directory to start the Rails server (the Puma server).

#### Install and Use Ruby on Rails 5

- **IMPORTANT:** You may need to use `rvm` to switch to an older version of Ruby (e.g., `ruby-2.6.6`) in order to run Rails 5.

- Install the latest version of Rails 5 by running `gem install rails -v 5.2.4.1`.

- Run `rails _5.2.4.1_ new <app_name>` to create a new Rails 5 application in your current directory (or just `rails new <app_name>` if only one version of Rails is installed on your current environment).
